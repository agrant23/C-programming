This program performs a basic cellular automaton. A grid, where the size is determined by the user, is initialized with a cell being on or off denoted by an asterisk for on; the initial probability of the "survival" of a cell is determined by the user. The number of neighbors of a cell, given by the user, determines if the cell survives onto the next generation or not. Cells that are not diagonal and cells that wrap onto the other side of the grid are a cells neighbors. The user also can decide which generations to view, such as every third generation, and how many generations to generate. The grid output for this is an output file where the path to the file destination is provided by the user.
